  appearance: The dugong is an aquatic mammal with thick, tough, and smooth skin. 
    The upper lip is cleft and muscular, hanging over the mouth, which is curved
    downwards. At first sight, dugongs look like whales, but they have evolved independently.
    They also develop tusks, which are visible in adult males.
  details: Dugongs are social animals but generally occur alone or in pairs of a
    mother and calf.Dugongs are shy in their nature and when disturbed, they quickly
    flee. When they don't flee, they usually explore the vessel or diver from a distance
    without coming closer.
